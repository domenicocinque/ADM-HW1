# ADM-HW1
This repository contains the Homework #1 for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course. 
The `HW1.ipynb` file contains a jupyter notebook with one exercise for every cell. The `stamps` file is a pdf that contains all the submissions as a certification of the effective resolution. I did all the exercises, if any of them is missing please let me know!
