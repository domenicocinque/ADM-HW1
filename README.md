# ADM-HW1
This repository contains the Homework #1 for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course. 
The `HW1.ipynb` file contains a jupyter notebook with one exercise for every cell. The `HW1_Stamps` folder contains the subfolders with the screenshots that certify the correctness of the exercises. I did all the exercises, if any of them is missing please let me know!
